Implementation of four sorting algorithms ( lsb Radix Sort, Merge Sort, Odd-Even Sort and Quick Sort ). These sorts are implemented primarily on the GPU and 
progressively sort the input random pixels in HSV space. 
The sorting algorithm allows user to select from a range of direction to choose from; i.e., diagonally or horizontal or vertically. The implementation heavily relies 
on SIMD instruction to speed up the process. 
The resulting effect of different algorithm is visualised across frames and can be seen below.
